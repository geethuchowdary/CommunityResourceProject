# CommunityResourceProject

Community Resources is a web application designed to centralize local resources and events for community support.


The homepage includes a dashboard with intuitive, card-style displays showing counts of events, resources, and categories.
Users can search and browse public community resources to assist in making recommendations for patients and families in need.
Advanced search functionality allows users to search by Zip Code, Name, and Date.
Admin users have the ability to add, edit, and delete resources.
General users can view and search resources without needing to log in.
